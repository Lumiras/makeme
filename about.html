        <h2>What is Make Me?</h2>

<p>Make Me raises awareness about the negative effects that the gender binary has on an individual’s outward expression of identity.</p>

<p>We all know the stereotypes: Pink is for girls. Blue is for boys. Women wear dresses. Men wear suits. Women are weak. Men are strong. Men don’t talk about their emotions. Women talk about them too much.</p>

<p>And we all know, at our core, that these are false. However, it’s almost impossible not to be influenced by society’s perception of what we’re supposed to wear and how we’re supposed to act.</p>

<p>We give one simple instruction. Make me beautiful. Make me handsome. Make me amazing. But what does it really mean to be beautiful, handsome, or amazing? That’s up to you, our audience, to decide.</p>

<p>This website is dedicated to showcasing all of the iterations Make Me takes over the course of its lifespan. Check back for updates to see what people created across Indiana.</p>

<h2>How Make Me came to life</h2>

<p>Make Me was created through the process of design thinking. We wanted to make something that was not only fun to participate in, but hit on topics that people really care about. Because of that, we went through three phases: research, ideation, and prototyping to get to what you see today.</p>

<p>During research, we interviewed over 78 people about what was important to them when it came to gender roles. Then, based on that research, we came up with fifty ideas for projects we might do. Those projects were put in front of people. When we asked for their thoughts, the favorite by far was Make Me. So that’s how we chose to bring it to life.</p>

<p>Make Me exists because of you. Although the negative effects of binary gender roles is an issue important to all members of Danger Laser Falcon, the final project is here in this iteration because it’s what our audience enjoyed and wanted to engage with. We couldn’t do it without you.</p>

<h2>The creators of Make Me</h2>

<p>Make Me is a production of <a href="http://www.dangerlaserfalcon.com">Danger Laser Falcon</a>, a media production collective of four graduate students currently attending the Center for Emerging Media Design and Development - Emily Cornetet, Elise Lockwood, Jared Lynch, and Sean May. Danger Laser Falcon is committed to making creative projects that use research and the design thinking process to solve real-world problems in a way that is entertaining and engaging. Their premiere project, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/soft-shadow/sets/downtown-muncie-orientation">Muncie Has Magic</a>, was a playful, choose-your-own-adventure audio tour of downtown Muncie in an effort to draw more people to the area. In the future, they hope to keep expanding the scope of their projects into Indianapolis and the wider Midwest.</p>
