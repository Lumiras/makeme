<p><a href="http://dangerlaserfalcon.com">Danger Laser Falcon</a> is making creative projects that use research and the design thinking process to solve real-world problems in a way that is entertaining and engaging and we’d like you to help us change the world.</p>

<p>We are a project group based out of Ball State University’s Center for <a href="http://centerforemdd.com">Emerging Media Design and Development</a> and although we receive a small amount of funding through the program, we are looking for sponsors, partners, and donors to help us truly achieve what we want to do.</p>

<p>Danger Laser Falcon has a very different process than many artists because we base what we make off of an extensive research process. For our current project, we started with academic research, interviews, and observations that involved over two hundred participants. We know that this is something people care about because they were involved every step of the way.</p>

<p>We are currently preparing to launch <em>Make Me</em>, an interactive experience that takes place both in real life and online. <em>Make Me</em> is targeted at raising awareness about the negative effects that the gender binary has on an individual’s outward expression of identity. So far, we are planning on bringing Make Me to Ball State’s campus, downtown Muncie, and Fountain Square in Indianapolis.</p>

<p>We are looking both for partners as well as sponsors. More detail about what we need and what we can offer is on the following pages. Every Danger Laser Falcon event will be free for everyone, forever, so we look forward to seeing you at our next project!</p>

<h3>Contact Us</h3>
<p>If you're interested in working with Danger Laser Falcon with any of the following things, let us know! You can email us at sean@dangerlaserfalcon.com or use our <a href="http://www.dangerlaserfalcon.com/#contact">Contact Us</a> form</p>
